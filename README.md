This Falooda cake is a perfect example of that! Falooda is a very famous Indian beverage. The original flavor is rose, however you can find many different flavors now a days like pistachio and mango. My fav is always rose though!! Falooda is milk based beverage with dry fruits, malai, ice cream, tutti frutti, rose syrup and other goodies!!
